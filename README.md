# Real-Time-Sales-Monitoring-Dashboard
This project involves building an automated ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory to transfer JSON-based NoSQL data from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and creating dynamic Power BI dashboards for real-time data visualization and analysis.


This project uses Azure services (e.g., Azure Data Factory, Azure Cosmos DB, etc.). Because running the project incurs costs for Azure resources, I have deleted the resources after use to avoid unnecessary charges.

Resources used:
- Resource Group
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Data Factory
- Storage Account
